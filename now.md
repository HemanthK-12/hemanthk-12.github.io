What I'm focused on right now (updated December 2024).

## Current Work

**Training autonomous drone navigation using PPO in Isaac Sim**  
Building a complete sim-to-real pipeline for quadcopter navigation. Currently working on domain randomization strategies and visual observation encoding. The goal is robust outdoor flight with obstacle avoidance.

**Exploring sim-to-real transfer techniques**  
Investigating how to minimize the reality gap between Isaac Sim and real hardware. Testing different approaches: domain randomization, system identification, and progressive training strategies.

## Learning

**Isaac Sim deep dive**  
Understanding the full Omniverse Kit stack, USD workflows, and custom sensor implementations. Taking detailed notes on common pitfalls and best practices.

**Classical control theory**  
Revisiting fundamentals — state-space representations, observability, controllability. Trying to bridge classical methods with modern RL approaches.

## Writing

Working on several blog posts:
- Debugging RL training failures (practical troubleshooting guide)
- Isaac Sim setup and workflow notes
- Domain randomization strategies that actually work
- Comparing PPO hyperparameters across different tasks

## Side Projects

**Control systems toolkit**  
Building a clean Python library for classical control implementations. Want something between toy examples and production code — useful for education and prototyping.

**Self-hosted infrastructure**  
Migrating everything to self-hosted solutions: Git, backups, monitoring. Writing about the process and lessons learned.
