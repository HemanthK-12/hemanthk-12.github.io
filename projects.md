## Drone RL Navigation

Autonomous quadcopter navigation using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Implements complete sim-to-real transfer pipeline with domain randomization, visual servoing, and collision avoidance.

**Tech Stack**: PyTorch, Isaac Sim, ROS2, Python  
**Links**: [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/drone-rl) • [Blog Post](/blog/2025/01/drone-rl)

## Multi-Agent Coordination Framework

Decentralized multi-agent path planning system for drone swarms using Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO). Handles communication constraints, cooperative objectives, and scalable to 20+ agents.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Isaac Gym, Ray RLlib, NumPy  
**Links**: [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-coordination)

## Control Systems Toolkit

Collection of classical and modern control algorithm implementations. Includes PID, Model Predictive Control (MPC), Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with comprehensive visualization tools.

**Tech Stack**: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib  
**Links**: [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/control-toolkit) • [Documentation](https://yourusername.github.io/control-toolkit)
